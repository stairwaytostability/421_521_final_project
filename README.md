## Brainstorming - A 21st Century Morning via Raspberry Pi

As college students, waking up can be one of the most arduous tasks of the day. 
We plan to design a programmable alarm clock that will incorporate at least two of the following hardware components: 
a speaker (for your choice of music), an RGB Smart lightbulb (to provide a gradual brightening to the room), a 3D printed attachment to a rotary motor (to open blinds at your desired wake up time), and a small pocket projector (to display video/images). 
Along with playing your music at either a web-scraped sunrise time or programmed alarm time, w
e plan to use the speaker to read out weather data, a newsfeed, or perhaps a podcast. 
Alternatively, we are thinking about connecting our Arduino to a small pocket projector we have to display and queue up either videos or images that would also add to our 21st century morning.


We plan to start with the lightbulb, then move to the speaker, and then make a decision on whether the blinds or projector would be a better element of complexity. 
oth options are particularly cool because they expand upon tasks that voice assistants such as Google Home and Amazon Echo cannot currently perform. 


## Abstract
Waking up for morning classes or meetings is especially challenging for college students.  A traditional alarm is sometimes not enough to wake students, and they sleep through important commitments.  However, waking up to an important message, email, or interesting news story provides greater stimulation and motivation to get out of bed. There is a need for a more engaging alarm clock system with a wider breadth of capabilities that will allow users to personalize their morning routine.

We are developing a novel alarm clock system with modern capabilities using Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Firstly, our system will include a Wifi-enabled RGB smart lightbulb that will allow the user to select a color of their choice.  At the time of the alarm, the lightbulb will gradually brighten and wake the user.  In addition, the alarm clock will have Bluetooth capabilities to hook up to a userâ€™s Bluetooth speaker and play a song of their choice as the auditory component. We will also incorporate a pocket projector to automatically provide the user with a display of the weather, news, or other relevant information to start their day.

Lastly, we will add a layer of complexity to turning off the alarm in order to ensure that the user is fully aware of their decision to shut it off. This will include a few simple math problems that require a level of cognition not possible for users who are still half asleep. The alarm clock will include a number pad input for the user to enter their answers.
