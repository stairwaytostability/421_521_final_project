Rice BIOE 421/521 Final Project


Brainstorming
#A 21st Century Morning via Raspberry Pi

As college students, waking up can be one of the most arduous tasks of the day. 
We plan to design a programmable alarm clock that will incorporate at least two of the following hardware components: 
a speaker (for your choice of music), an RGB Smart lightbulb (to provide a gradual brightening to the room), a 3D printed attachment to a rotary motor (to open blinds at your desired wake up time), and a small pocket projector (to display video/images). 
Along with playing your music at either a web-scraped sunrise time or programmed alarm time, w
e plan to use the speaker to read out weather data, a newsfeed, or perhaps a podcast. 
Alternatively, we are thinking about connecting our Arduino to a small pocket projector we have to display and queue up either videos or images that would also add to our 21st century morning.


We plan to start with the lightbulb, then move to the speaker, and then make a decision on whether the blinds or projector would be a better element of complexity. 
oth options are particularly cool because they expand upon tasks that voice assistants such as Google Home and Amazon Echo cannot currently perform.
